=head1 NAME

Games::Mafia - Perl implementation of the mafia party game.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a game object which can perform the necessary logic for hosting/running
a mafia game.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $game = Games::Mafia->new;
  #blah blah blah

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The following attributes may be passed to the constructor.

=head2 day_count

Integer for the day counter. Defaults to 1.

=head2 day_start

Bool for if the game started at day. Defaults to 0.

=head2 is_day

Bool for if the game state is currently day. Defaults to C<day_start>.

=head2 allow_nolynch

Bool for if votes on 'Nobody' are allowed during the day. Defaults to 1.

'Nobody' cannot be killed, so votes on him/her will do nothing, but the option 
to vote on a dummy is useful when players wish to pass the day/night without
killing/lynching someone.

=head2 allow_nokill

Bool for if votes on 'Nobody' are allowed during the night. Defaults to 1.

=head1 METHODS

Unless stated otherwise, methods will return the Games::Mafia object -- useful
for chaining.

=head2 new

Constructor. Values for keys C<players>, C<votes>, and C<actions> will be given
to the respective C<add_> methods.

  my $game = Games::Mafia->new(
    day_count     => 1,
    day_start     => 1,

    players => {
      Player1 => {role => 'Townie'},
      Player2 => {role => 'Goon'},
    },
    votes => {
      Player1 => 'Player2',
      Player2 => 'Player1',
    },
  );

=cut

sub new {
	my $class = shift;
	my %a = @_;
	my $self = bless {
		players => {},
		actions => {},
		logs => [],
	}, $class;
	
	$self->{tally} = Games::Mafia::Tally->new($self);
	$self->{players}->{Nobody} = Games::Mafia::Player->new(
		game => $self,
		key  => 'Nobody',
	);
	
	$self->{day_count}      = $a{day_count}     // 1;
	$self->{day_start}      = $a{day_start}     // 0;
	$self->{is_day}         = $a{is_day}        // $self->{day_start};
	$self->{allow_nolynch}  = $a{allow_nolynch} // 1;
	$self->{allow_nokill}   = $a{allow_nokill}  // 1;
	
	$self->log(
		message => "Game created.",
		private => 0,
	);
	
	if(defined $a{players}) {
		for(keys %{$a{players}}) {
			$self->add_player( $_, $a{players}{$_} );
		}
	}	
	
	if(defined $a{votes}) {
		for(keys %{$a{votes}}) {
			$self->add_vote  ( $_, $a{votes}{$_} );
		}
	}
	
	if(defined $a{actions}) {
		for(keys %{$a{actions}}) {
			$self->add_action( $_, $a{votes}{$_} );
		}
	}
	
	return $self;
}

=head2 run

Tick from day to night, or vice versa, performing any lynching or power-role 
actions that are currently queued.

This method should not be given any arguments. Actions and votes should be
queued with the relevant methods beforehand.

The logic of when this method is run should be determined by the operating 
script.

=cut

sub run {
	my $self = shift;
	if(@_) { croak "run takes no arguments." }
	
	return $self if $self->winners;
	
	my $n = $self->electorate;
	
	if($self->{is_day}) {
		$_->lynch for grep { $self->tally->on($_) > $n/2 } $self->players_alive;
	} 
	else {
		$_->kill for grep { $self->tally->on($_) > $n/2 } $self->players_alive;
	}
	$self->tally->reset;
	
	return $self if $self->winners;

	$self->{day_count}++ if $self->{day_start} != $self->{is_day};
	$self->{is_day} = !$self->{is_day};
	
	return $self;
}

=head2 winners

Returns an array of all players whose win condition has been met.

=cut

sub winners {
	my $self = shift;
	
	return grep { $_->is_winner } $self->players;
}

=head2 add_player

Adds a player to the game. The player's key may not be 'Nobody'.

  $game->add_player(Player1 => {
    name => 'Alfred',
    role => 'Goon',
  });

The player created is a L<Games::Mafia::Player> object.

All C<add_*> and C<remove_*> methods can add or remove more than one thing at a 
time if given a series of things to add or remove, e.g.:

  $game->add_player(
    Player1 => {
      name => 'Bob',
      role => 'Townie',
    },
    Player2 => {
      name => 'Geoff',
      role => 'Goon',
    },
  );

=cut

sub add_player {
	my $self = shift;
	
	while(@_) {
		my $key  = shift;
		my %a = %{+shift};
		my $role = delete $a{role} or croak "Players must have a role.";
		
		croak "Role '$role' does not exist." unless
			grep { $role eq $_} Games::Mafia::Player->roles;
			
		croak "Player with key '$key' already exists." if 
			grep { $key eq $_->key } $self->players;
			
		$a{name} //= $key;
		$a{game}   = $self;
		$a{key}    = $key;
		
		$self->{players}->{$key} = "Games::Mafia::Player::$role"->new(%a);
		$self->player($key)->vote('');
		$self->log(
			message => $a{name} . " has joined the game.",
			private => 0,
		);
	}
	
	return $self;
}

=head2 remove_player

  $game->remove_player($john);

Removes a player from the game.

Note: This is different from a player being killed. This method will completely 
remove the player from the game. The player's logs will still be left behind, 
but otherwise all record of the player will be removed from the game.

=cut

sub remove_player {
	my $self = shift;

		);
		undef $player;
	}
