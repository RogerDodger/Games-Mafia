Games::Mafia
============

Games::Mafia runs a game of Mafia.

A basic game has two teams -- Town and Mafia -- uninformed majority against
informed minority.

The mafia vote to kill a single player each night, and win if they outnumber
the town during the day.

During the day, the players gather to decide on a player to lynch. The town win
if no players in the mafia remain.

This module handles vote tallying, lynching, night kills, power-role actions, 
logging, etc. -- mostly anything you'd need for hosting a game.
